# Passepartout

Initially, passepartout was a python+tk+sqlite application I wrote for password
management.

I would like to update the project and maybe rewrite it in a different language
though I hesitate between several candidates.

I know virtually nothing about Rust, but my latest fancy is to try and learn
Rust by porting passepartout to a Rust+Gtk+sqlite platform. Let's see if it
takes me somewhere.
